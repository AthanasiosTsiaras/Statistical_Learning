> It is aimed for those who are now starting their journey in programming, or for those who just want to sharpen their skills.
> R is a very powerful tool and even though it can be use for a plethora of applications, I think it's especially good in statistics
> The R community is extremely large - meaning that you can find answers to your problems by just googling them.
> The concepts introduced range from basic statistics to intermediate modeling - this is not a statistics guide, it is 
a statistics guide for R! It would be very beneficial for the reader to have a statistical background.
